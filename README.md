# Zeller Test Task

This is a test task, created to provide a demo. As the API key was not working, I cloned the mock-server folder and used it to fetch the data.

Note:

1: Node version used : 18.17.0, Pod version used : 1.14.3

2: Please open terminal in server folder and run these command to start the server, or else data would not be fetched.

`npm run start`
